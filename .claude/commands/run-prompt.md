# Run Prompt

Execute prompts generated by the strategy system.

## How to Use

```

```

## Process

   - Indexer → `docs/issues/indexer/README.md`
   - Movement network → `docs/issues/movement/README.md`
   - Tooling → `docs/issues/tooling/README.md`
4. **Execute** all requirements listed
5. **Verify** using the verification steps
6. **Delete** the prompt file when complete
7. **Report** what was accomplished

## After Completion
